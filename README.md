### Core Components

This **Polymarket trading bot** architecture consists of:

- **MempoolMonitorService**: Monitors Polygon mempool for pending transactions
- **TradeExecutorService**: Executes frontrunning trades with priority gas pricing
- **Validation Utilities**: Comprehensive validation for addresses, keys, and configuration
- **CLOB Client Factory**: Manages Polymarket CLOB client initialization

The **Polymarket bot** is built with modularity in mind, making it easy to extend and customize for specific trading strategies.

### How It Works

This **Polymarket trading bot** operates through a sophisticated multi-phase process:

1. **Monitoring Phase**: The **Polymarket bot** continuously monitors both the Polygon mempool and Polymarket API for pending trades from target addresses
2. **Detection Phase**: When a pending trade is detected, the **Polymarket trading bot** analyzes trade size, market conditions, and transaction status
3. **Validation Phase**: The bot validates sufficient balances, trade size thresholds, and market availability
4. **Execution Phase**: If conditions are met, the **Polymarket bot** executes a frontrunning trade with:
   - Calculated frontrun size (based on multiplier)
   - Priority gas pricing (based on gas multiplier)
   - Immediate order submission
5. **Monitoring Phase**: The **Polymarket trading bot** tracks execution status and handles retries if needed

This workflow ensures the **Polymarket bot** can react quickly to trading opportunities while maintaining reliability and error handling.
